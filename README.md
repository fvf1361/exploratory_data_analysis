Coursera Assignment 1

This repositry contains 4 R scripts and 4 png plots as the following:

- `Plot1.R`
- `Plot2.R`
- `Plot3.R`
- `Plot4.R`


- `Plot1.png`
- `Plot2.png`
- `Plot3.png`
- `Plot4.png`

The plots summarize the household energy usage over a 2-day period in February 2007.
Original data downlaoded from UCI web site

The following describes the 9 variables in the dataset:

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- Submetering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
